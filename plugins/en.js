    // .................     start Questions  ...........................................


  what_defi: "What is DeFi?",
  what_defi_desc:
    `
    <p> DeFi stands for “decentralized finance” which is an overall term to describe a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain – enabling application of decentralization on financial intermediaries such as banks. You’re all aware of how centralized financial institutions operate. They hold all the money deposited by you and other customers and whenever you need to send the money to someone or a loan from the bank you’re subjected to a long, bureaucratic, and tedious process. Other than the inefficiency, the bank takes some percentage of the money in terms of transaction fee. </p>
    <p> What DeFi does is to make financial transactions faster, cheaper, and generally more efficient.</p>
    <p> A DeFi application makes it easy for people to transact money without the need to trust one another. That is, DeFi platforms are built on blockchain to help facilitate financial transactions with the help of smart contracts. </p>
    <p> DeFi is allowing crypto entrepreneurs to recreate traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside of banks or central authorities’ control. </p>
  `,
  what_smart_contract: "What are Smart Contracts?",
  what_smart_contract_desc:
    `
    <p>Smart Contracts are automated applications that act as intermediaries.</p>
    <p>This is a piece of code in the blockchain that helps peers (humans and applications such as other smart contracts) to interact on the platform without the need to trust each other.</p>
    <p>The code of Smart Contracts is always available to the public, that’s why the blockchain technology is often called “trustless”</p>
  `,
  what_liquidity_meaning: "What Is Liquidity Mining?",
  what_liquidity_meaning_desc:
    `
    <p>Liquidity mining means adding tokens to liquidity pools of DEXs (decentralized exchanges) such as Uniswap, Sushiswap or PancakeSwap.</p>
    <p> By providing liquidity to the market, you allow the decentralized exchange to function, and in return you are rewarded with cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p> Adding liquidity to decentralized exchanges is called “liquidity mining” because it can bring you profits just like mining cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>
    <p>Both liquidity mining and mining crypto are excellent ways of generating blockchain-based passive income.</p>
  `,
  what_liquidity_pool: "What exactly are “liquidity pools”?",
  what_liquidity_pool_desc: `When you use a centralized exchange like Binance or Coinbase, the liquidity is provided by the company which owns the exchange. Since decentralized exchanges don’t have their own reserves, liquidity is provided by the users who lock their own funds in liquidity pools. Simply put, liquidity pools are what allows you to buy and sell crypto on DEXs.`,
  what_dao: "What is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?",
  what_dao_desc:
    `
      <p> A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a software running on a blockchain that offers users a built-in model for the collective management of its code. </p>
      <p> DAOs differ from traditional organizations managed by boards, committees and executives. Rather than being governed by a limited group, DAOs use a set of rules written down in code and enforced by the network of computers running a shared software. </p>
      <p> To become a member of a DAO, users need to first join the DAO by buying its cryptocurrency. Holding the asset then generally gives users the power to vote on proposals and updates, proportional to the amount they hold. </p>
    `,
  what_dao_governance: "What is DAO Governance?",
  what_dao_governance_desc:
   `
    <p>DAO governance is coordinated using tokens or NFTs that grant voting powers.</p>
    <p>Admission to a DAO is limited to people who have a confirmed ownership of these governance tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet, and membership can be exchanged. Governance is conducted through a series of proposals that members vote on through the blockchain, and the possession of more governance tokens often translates to greater voting power.</p>
  `,
  how_use_network: "How can I use GYM NETWORK?",
  how_use_network_desc:
    `
      <p> You can use it as a Vault, as a Single Farm, and as Liquidity Mining. So you have three ways to get more out of your tokens. </p>
      <p> In parallel we are always working on the utility of the GYMNET Token. The more GYMNET Tokens you hold, the better access you get to future projects! See the Meta-networks.io roadmap. You will need GYMNET Token to get exclusive benefits and at the same time GYMNET Rewards. </p>
      <p> In summary it means: You can use GYM NETWORK as a DeFi platform and also as a constantly evolving metaverse. And of course, to make an affiliate career and earn lucrative commissions! </p>
    `,
  which_wallet_use_to_connect: "Which wallets can I use to connect?",
  which_wallet_use_to_connect_desc: `You can use Metamask, Trust Wallet and all offered wallets under the item WALLET CONNECT.`,
  what_apy_apr: "What is APY and APR?",
  what_apy_apr_desc:
    `
      <p>APR represents the annual rate charged for earning or borrowing money.</p>
      <p>APY takes into account compounding, but APR does not.</p>
    `,
  where_rewords_vaults_come_from:"Where do the rewards in the Vault come from?",
  where_rewords_vaults_come_from_desc:
    `
      <p> Each Vault is connected to a well-known and already established DeFi protocol. In this case, the BNB/GYMNET Vault is connected to the ALPACAplatform. </p>
      <p> There, for example, users can borrow money against an interest. This interest is the return for you as a user and comes from there. In addition, you get GYMNET tokens as a reward from our platform.  </p>
      <p>  This gives you an unbeatable advantage over users who use e.g. <b>ALPACA</b> directly without GYM NETWORK!  </p>
    `,
  who_what_alpaca: "Who or what is ALPACA?",
  who_what_alpaca_desc:
    `
      <p>
        <a href='https://www.alpacafinance.org/' target='_blank'>Alpaca Finance <a/>
        is the largest lending protocol allowing leveraged yield farming on Binance Smart Chain. It helps lenders earn safe and stable yields, and offers borrowers undercollateralized loans for leveraged yield farming positions, vastly multiplying their farming principals and resulting profits.
      </p>
    `,
  what_binance: "What is Binance Smart Chain?",
  what_binance_desc: `Binance Chain was launched by Binance in April 2019. Its primary focus is to facilitate fast, decentralized (or non-custodial) trading. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest decentralized application (or DApp) on it is Binance DEX, one of the friendliest decentralized exchanges out there. You can use it via a web interface at binance.org or through its native integration with Trust Wallet.`,
  what_do_with_gymnet: "What can I do with GYMNET Token?",
  what_do_with_gymnet_desc:
    `
      <p> The more GYMNET Tokens you hold, the better access you get to future projects! See the Meta-networks.io roadmap. You will need GYMNET Token to get exclusive benefits and at the same time GYMNET Rewards. </p>
      <p> The use cases are: You can use GYM NETWORK and its Reward Token GYMNET as a DeFi platform in the VAULT, the Single Farm, and for Liquidity Mining, as well as a constantly evolving metaverse. </p>
    `,
  where_gymnet_lysted: "Where is GYMNET Token listed?",
  where_gymnet_lysted_desc: `You can find GYMNET on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. It is tradeable on PancakeSwap.`,
  where_find_tutorials: "Where can I find Tutorials?",
  where_find_tutorials_desc: `You can access all our video tutorials on our YouTube channel and also in the documentation on Gitbook.`,
  how_affiliate_work: "How does the affiliate system work?",
  how_affiliate_work_desc:
    `
      <p> The affiliate system works directly through your wallet. Each wallet must be linked to a Telegram account when you sign up (only by invitation with an affiliate link). This is important for support requests and much more! </p>
      <p> After that you will be assigned your own affiliate link which you can use to become a member. If someone now signs up and invests in the Vault and gets rewards, you also get "passive" commissions. </p>
      <p> So whenever your referred investor (you have a referrer status) decides to use GYM NETWORK and gets his first VAULT rewards, you will get a commission. Over and over again, as long as the user leaves his investment in the Vault. This way you can build up a lucrative passive income.</p>
      <p> The affiliate system has a total of 16 levels and other highlights that will help you get started as a tipster! Take a look at the webinars or the presentation PDF or contact your sponsor for more details.</p>

  //   "<p><b>Preamble</b></p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p>The LICENSER is an innovative company that distributes a high-tech and novel concept of Fin Tech and digital services. The licensee is a company focused on direct marketing for third parties, which is to support the purchase of the services of the LICENSER in the contract territory as a tipster in the marketing of its services via its affiliated affiliate network (sales partner network).</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p>It should be expressly pointed out that the LICENSER does not directly or indirectly distribute FinTech services such as DeFi services, cryptocoin trading or comparable services itself, since only participation in the Metaverse is possible in order to purchase their services from third-party providers. This requirement must be complied with by the licensee and his affiliated sales partner network and the licensee must impose contractual requirements on his sales partner network in accordance with it and must monitor compliance with the specifications.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p>The contracting parties conclude this contract in order to achieve the best possible success with the will and in the expectation to promote the business efforts of the distributor and the LICENSERS. The contracting parties will endeavor to satisfy the demands of the sales partners and buyers (end customers) in every way in trusting cooperation and by optimizing the services in sales and sales partner and customer service. Preceded by this, the contracting parties conclude the following <b>master tipster contract:</b></p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><b>&sect; 1 Subject matter of the contract and contract territory</b></p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p>(1) The licensee receives for himself and his affiliated affiliate network (these affiliates will be called sales partners in the future) from the LICENSER for the duration of the contract for the distribution channel of network marketing based direct marketing the simple distribution right for all services in the territory <b>worldwide (except USA) (in future contract area).</b></p>\n" +
  //   "<p> a) Distribution law means the following: The licensee and his affiliated sales partner network act as tipsters for the LICENSER. The subject of the tipster activity is only the establishment of contact between the commercial customers and/or end user customers and the LICENSER against receipt of a tipster commission after successful conclusion of this customer's contract with the LICENSER.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p>Definition of tipster: As tipsters, the licensee's contract partners may only establish contact between the LICENSER and potential interested parties and may not provide any other sales, consulting or brokerage services. The LICENSER expressly points out that in the event of a violation of this requirement, he expressly reserves the right to terminate the contract with the licensee immediately extraordinarily, unless he immediately acts on the acting sales partner by issuing an extraordinary termination of the same.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p> b) Worldwide, this means the following: The tipster may operate in any country of the world with the exception of the USA the services of the LICENSER as a master tipster with its connected distribution network, provided that the services of the LICENSER may be marketed in this state and may not be distributed and/or otherwise marketed against applicable law or only after receipt of an official or otherwise state license.

  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><strong>II. General Tipster Conditions</strong> <br><br>\n" +
  //   "<strong>&sect; 1 Scope of application</strong><br><br>\n" +
  //   "(1) The following terms and conditions are an integral part of every tipster contract between Affiliate Company and the independent and autonomous contractual partner (hereinafter: tipster), who expressly does not carry out any advice and may not carry it out.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p>(2) Affiliate Company provides its services exclusively on the basis of these General Tipster Conditions.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><strong>&sect; 2 Subject matter of the contract (tipster)</strong><br><br>\n" +
  //   "(1) Affiliate Company is a direct sales enterprise that uses a social selling sales concept to distribute services/products from manufacturers, product providers and other third-party companies (in the future third-party companies), in particular from the field of IT and virtual/digital services/products. <br><br>\n" +
  //   "It should be expressly pointed out that Affiliate Company does not sell FinTech services such as DeFi services, crypto coin trading, investments, currency investments, forex trading services, other finance products or comparable services directly or indirectly for third-party companies.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(2) The subject of the tipster activity is the establishment of contact between the commercial customer and / or end consumer customers and the third-party company against receipt of a tipster commission after successful conclusion of the contract of this customer with the third-party company for the purchase of its products / services. For this activity, it is not mandatory that the tipster makes financial expenses, he accepts a minimum number of services from Affiliate Company or the tipster advertises other tipsters. All you need is the free registration. In addition, without any obligation to do so, there is the further possibility of advertising other tipsters for a tipster activity for Affiliate Company in order to obtain a tipster audit at their performance/product brokerage for the respective third-party company. Explicitly no tipster provision (in the future commission) receives the tipster for the mere application of a new tipster. The commission as well as the method of payment or other fulfillment of the commission claim is based on the compensation plan in force at that time.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(3) For the commencement and execution of its activities, Affiliate Company provides the tipster with an online back office (together with affiliate link) that enables the tipster to have an always up-to-date and comprehensive overview of his sales, commissions and the customers and downline developments.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><strong>&sect; 3 General requirements for the conclusion of the contract / KYC verification procedure</strong><br><br>\n" +
  //   "(1) A contract can be concluded with legal persons, partnerships or natural persons who have reached the age of 18 and are entrepreneurs in accordance with applicable law and in possession of a business license, if necessary. A contract by consumers is not possible.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(2) If a legal entity or a partnership (GbR, OHG, KG, etc.) is a tipster or if a tipster submits an application, the corresponding commercial register extract about the registration as well as the VAT identification number must be submitted &ndash; if available at a partnership. All shareholders must be at least 18 years of age. The shareholders are personally liable to Affiliate Company for the conduct of the legal entity.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(3) Affiliate Company reserves after sending the contractual partner application of any tipster a proof of age, a proof of business license, a commercial register extract (applies only to legal entities or a partnership registered in the commercial register), an account verification as well as proof of identity of the applicant or the person responsible in this respect within the framework of a &quot;KYC procedure&quot; expressly before acceptance of the contract application.<br> <br>\n" +
  //   "(4) Each tipster is only entitled to acquire a position in the remuneration plan, whereby circumvention of this requirement by registration as a natural person and additionally via a legal person or partnership is prohibited. If a tipster registers more than one position in the remuneration plan on himself or a legal entity or partnership registered by him or otherwise directly or indirectly, Affiliate Company expressly reserves the right of termination referred to in paragraph (8).<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(5) The tipster is obliged to complete the online tipster application completely and properly and to transmit it to Affiliate Company electronically. In addition, the tipster accepts with a separate &quot;tick&quot; on the application form these General Tipster Conditions as having been taken note of and as part of the contract. Affiliate Company reserves the right to obtain further information from the tipster in individual cases.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(6) Changes to the personal data of the tipsters must be reported to Affiliate Company immediately.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(7) Affiliate Company reserves the right to reject tipster requests at its sole discretion without any justification. Insofar as online order or order forms are used, these are considered part of the contract.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(8) In the event of a breach of the obligations laid down in paragraphs (1), (2) and (4), Affiliate Company entitles without prior warning to terminate the tipster contract without notice and, if necessary, to reclaim paid commissions. In addition, Affiliate Company expressly reserves the right to assert further claims for damages in this case of termination without notice.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><strong>&sect; 4 Status of the tipster as an entrepreneur</strong><br><br>\n" +
  //   "(1) The tipster acts as an autonomous and independent entrepreneur. He is neither an employee nor a commercial agent or the broker of Affiliate Company and also not contractually associated with the respective third-party company. There are no sales targets, acceptance, distribution or other activity obligations. With the exception of contractual obligations, the tipster is not subject to any instructions from Affiliate Company and bears the full entrepreneurial risk of his business activities, including the obligation to bear all his business costs and the obligation to pay his employees properly, if he employs some.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(2) The tipster must set up and operate his business in the sense of a prudent businessman, which also includes the operation of his own offices or a workplace managed in the sense of a prudent businessman.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "(3) As an independent entrepreneur, the tipster is responsible for compliance with the relevant legal provisions, including tax and social law requirements (e.g. obtaining a VAT identification number, registering his employees with the social security system, as well as for obtaining a business license, if necessary). In this respect, the tipster assures that all commission income that he generates in the course of his activity for Affiliate Company is properly taxed at his registered office. Affiliate Company reserves the right to deduct the respective sum for taxes and duties from the agreed commission or to claim damages or reimbursement of expenses incurred by a violation of the aforementioned requirements, unless the tipster is not responsible for the damage or expense. Affiliate Company does not pay any social security contributions for the tipster. The tipster is not authorized to make declarations or make commitments on behalf of Affiliate Company.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><strong>&sect; 5 Voluntary contractual cancellation policy</strong><br><br>\n" +

The period begins with the online transmission of the tipster application. To comply with the revocation period, the timely dispatch (date of the postmark / e-mail) of the revocation is sufficient. <br>\n" +
  //   "<br><strong>Waiver of the right of withdrawal</strong><br><br>\n" +
  //   "A handover/transmission/provision of services as well as the possibility to act as a tipster takes place only after expiry of the revocation period. If a handover/transmission/provision of services or the start of the tipster activity is desired by the tipster before the expiry of the revocation period, he thereby expressly waives his right of revocation.<br>\n" +
  //   "<br><strong>Consequences of revocation:</strong><br><br>\n" +
  //   "In the event of an effective revocation of the contractual declaration, the services received by both parties shall be returned and any benefits derived shall be surrendered. If you are unable to return the received service to us in whole or in part or only in a deteriorated condition, you may have to pay us compensation for the value. Obligations to refund payments must be fulfilled within 30 days. The period begins for you with the dispatch of your declaration of revocation or the item.<br>\n" +
  //   "A tipster can register with Affiliate Company again after exercising his right of withdrawal. The prerequisite is that the revocation of the tipster is at least 6 months ago and the revoking tipster has not performed any activities for Affiliate Company during this time.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "End of the cancellation policy</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><strong>&sect; 6 Use of the back office</strong><br><br>\n" +

The back office and the other usable tools, including their changes and adjustments, are the property of Affiliate Company. The tipster is prohibited from deleting or destroying copyright and other proprietary notices.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><strong>&sect; 7 Obligations of the tipster in the context of advertising and general obligations</strong><br><br>\n" +
  //   "(1) The tipster is obliged to protect his personal passwords and login identifiers from access by third parties. The tipster is prohibited from violating the rights of Affiliate Company, its tipsters, third-party companies, affiliated companies or other third parties, harassing third parties or otherwise violating applicable law. In particular, the tipster is not permitted to provide false or misleading information about the services/products of the third-party company, the Affiliate Company services or the sales system of Affiliate Company. In the context of his tipster activity, the tipster will only make such statements about the services/products of the third-party company, Affiliate Company, the Affiliate Company services as well as about the Affiliate Company distribution system in the context of the establishment of contact, which correspond to the content of the specifications of the third-party company and / or the Affiliate Company advertising and information materials.

  //   "(3) The tipster is prohibited from violating competition law or otherwise violating applicable law in his work and must always comply with the following relevant advertising guidelines:<br><br>\n" +
  //   "Special Advertising Guidelines<br><br>\n" +
  //   "a) At no point and on any advertising material may the tipster make or claim untrue, misleading or exaggerated information about his income or the earning potential at Affiliate Company. Rather, there is always the obligation to expressly point out to potential tipsters in the context of initiation talks that only very few tipsters can achieve a higher income with their work for Affiliate Company.<br><br>\n" +
  //   "b) Neither the tipster nor Affiliate Company refer crypto trading services, forex trading services as well as a mediation / advice in the field of securities, investment or other financial investments or products for the respective third-party company against potential Interested parties or customers, but act exclusively as tipsters in the field of establishing contact / mediation for the useof the products / services of the respective third-party company. The tipster is therefore obliged to comply with the aforementioned requirements in a mandatory and stringent manner and to inform potential interested parties about this circumstance in the tipster activity. It also applies that the tipster must limit himself with regard to the products/services of the respective third-party company only to the activity of establishing contact and the passing on/forwarding of the necessary information from/to potential customers.<br>\n" +

  //   "d) Distribution and marketing activities may not feign commissions that are to be understood as a &quot;head premium&quot; or other commission in connection with the mere recruitment of a new tipster. No action shall be taken to give the impression that the advertised distribution system is an unlawful distribution system, namely an illegal progressive Ponzi scheme or pyramid scheme or any other fraudulent distribution system. Nor may it be pretended that the third-party company offers products/services that require approval or are otherwise unlawful.<br>\n" +
  //   "e) Tipster actions may not be aimed at minors or inexperienced persons and in no way exploit their age, illness or limited insight to induce consumers to conclude a contract. In the case of contacts with so-called socially weak or foreign-language population groups, the tipsters will take due account of their financial capacity and their ability to understand and understand languages. Anything that could cause the members of such groups to place orders with the third-party company that are not appropriate to their circumstances shall be refrained from.<br>\n" +

  //   "h) Potential customers are not induced to accept services by dubious and/or misleading promises or by promises of special advantages if these advantages are linked to future, uncertain successes. The tipsters will refrain from anything that could cause potential customers to accept products/services of the third-party company solely in order to do the tipster a personal favor, to end an unwanted conversation or to benefit from an advantage that is not the subject of the offer or to be responsible for the granting of such an advantage to show appreciation.<br>\n" +

  //   "(3) The tipster is also prohibited from violating other tipsters or other distribution contracts that he has concluded with other companies and whose clauses are still effective by concluding a tipster contract.<br>\n" +
  //   "(4) Insofar as the tipster is simultaneously active for other competitors, other companies or networks, online marketing or other direct marketing companies, he undertakes to design the respective activity (together with his respective downline) in such a way that no connection or mixing with his activity takes place for the other company. In particular, subject to a different consent, the tipster may not offer services other than the products/services of the third-party company or Affiliate Company at the same time at the same place or in the immediate vicinity or on the same website, Facebook page, other social media platform, chat room or Internet platform, except Affiliate Company has expressly approved this, for example because there is an official cooperation between Affiliate Company and this company.</p>\n" +

The acquisition and placement of the new tipster must be done through your own affiliate link, whereby the date and time of receipt of the registration application of the new tipster at Affiliate Company apply to the allocation. If two tipsters claim the same tipster as &quot;newly&quot; sponsored, Affiliate Company will only consider the sponsor named in the initial registration.<br>\n" +
  //   "(2) Affiliate Company is entitled to delete the account and thus all personal data, including the e-mail address of the tipster from the system if advertising mailings, cover letters or e-mails with the notes &quot;warped&quot;, &quot;deceased&quot;, &quot;not accepted&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot; or similar are returned and the tipster does not correct the incorrect data within a period of 30 days. <br>\n" +
  //   "(3) Furthermore, crossline sponsoring and attempting to do so within the company are prohibited. Crossline sponsorship means the acquisition of a person or company that is already a tipster at Affiliate Company in another sales line or has had a tipster contract within the last 6 months. In this respect, it is also prohibited to use the name of the spouse, relatives, trade names, corporations, partnerships, trusts, or other third parties to circumvent this provision.<br>\n" +
  //   "(4) Bonus manipulation is prohibited. This includes, in particular, sponsoring tipsters who actually do not carry out the Affiliate Company business at all (so-called straw men), as well as open or veiled multiple registrations. In this respect, it is also prohibited to use the name of the spouse, relatives, persons of the same household, trade names, corporations, partnerships, trust companies, or other third parties to circumvent this provision. It is also prohibited to induce third parties to purchase services in order to achieve a better position in the compensation plan or otherwise to cause bonus manipulation. <br>\n" +

  //   "(1) In the event of a first breach of the obligations of the tipster and/or tipster regulated in &sect; 7, Affiliate Company shall issue a written warning stating a deadline of 10 days to remedy the breach of duty. The tipster undertakes to reimburse the warning costs, in particular the lawyer's fees incurred for the warning.<br>\n" +
  //   "(2) Explicit reference is made to &sect; 16 paragraph (3), according to which Affiliate Company is entitled to extraordinary termination without prior warning in the event of a violation of the obligations regulated in &sect; 8, 9 and 10 (3) and (4) as well as in the event of a particularly serious violation of the contractual or statutory law applicable in &sect; 7, other applicable contractual or statutory law.

  //   "(3) If, after expiry of the remedy period set by the warning, the same or a core violation occurs again or if the originally warned violation is not remedied, a contractual penalty levied at the discretion of Affiliate Company and to be reviewed by the competent court shall be due immediately. For the assertion of the contractual penalty, further lawyer's fees are also incurred, which the tipster is obliged to reimburse, which is already expressly pointed out.<br>\n" +
  //   "(4) Notwithstanding the forfeited contractual penalty, the tipster is also liable for all damages incurred by Affiliate Company as a result of a breach of duty within the meaning of &sect;&sect; 7 &ndash; 9 and &sect; 10 paragraphs 3 and 4, unless the tipster is not responsible for the breach of duty.<br>\n" +
  //   "(5) The tipster shall release Affiliate Company from liability in the event of a claim by a third party due to a violation of one of the obligations regulated in &sect;&sect; 7 &ndash; 9 and &sect; 10 paragraphs 3 and 4 or any other violation of applicable law by the tipster, on the first request of the Affiliate Company.

Affiliate Company will notify the tipster of the change within a reasonable period of time prior to the change. Reductions in commission shares by more than 5% or give the tipster the right to object to the change. If he does not object to the amended conditions within one month of notification, these conditions shall become part of the contract. Changes known at the time of conclusion of the tipster contract are not subject to notification and do not constitute a right of objection on the part of the tipster. In the event of an objection, Affiliate Company is entitled to terminate the contract at the time when the amended or supplementary terms and conditions are to come into force.<br>\n" +

  //   "(1) As remuneration for a successful establishment of contact, the tipster receives a tipster commission in accordance with the applicable remuneration plan if this contact establishment leads to the conclusion of a contract between a customer and the respective third-party company. The withdrawal of the tipster's commission takes place according to the common will of the parties exclusively in the cryptocoins shown in the back office, which the tipster expressly acknowledges as part of the contract by concluding this contract. <br>\n" +
  //   "(2) A successful establishment of contact within the meaning of paragraph (1) only exists if the contract is subsequently concluded between a customer and the respective third-party company. In particular, a commission claim does not arise or expires retroactively if<br>\n" +
  //   " a. the customer makes use of his right of revocation, withdrawal or contestation vis-&agrave;-vis the third-party company;</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p> b. the establishment of contact with the third-party company has been unlawfully established;</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p> c. the third-party company refuses to accept the contract at its own discretion.<br>\n" +
  //   "In addition, in cases of fraudulent contact, either due to fraudulent or abusive measures of the tipster or the customer in relation to the third-party company, no commission claim arises.<br>\n" +
  //   "Should a revenue already concluded with the third-party company be ineffective and/or reversed in accordance with paragraph (2) or for other reasons, commissions already paid shall be refunded.<br>\n" +
  //   "(3) The contracting parties agree that no claims exist or can be asserted for a higher commission than the commission on which this contract is based. The commission covers all claims of the tipster, in particular all travel costs, expenses, office costs, telephone costs or other expenses, as well as all other costs associated with the fulfillment of the contract. With the payment of the remuneration in accordance with paragraph (1), all services of the tipster are also compensated, in particular also for the production and maintenance of the customer base of the third-party company, as well as the resulting future market potential and exist in the sense of an advance payment for this, so that in the event of termination of the contract, by which party and for whatever reason, no severance payments and/or compensation claims for whatever legal reason are to be paid by Affiliate Company.<br>\n" +
  //   "(4) Affiliate Company is entitled to offset claims and/or claims for repayment to which Affiliate Company is entitled against the tipster against his commission claims in whole or in part. Assignments and pledging of claims of the tipster from this contract are excluded, unless mandatory law precludes this. The encumbrance of the contract with rights of third parties is not permitted, unless the mandatory law precludes it.<br>\n" +
  //   "(5) All payments from Affiliate Company to the tipster are considered net payments. The tipster will check the issued invoices as soon and inform Affiliate Company immediately of any objections. Incorrect commissions must be notified to Affiliate Company in writing within 60 days of the incorrect payment. After this date, the commissions are considered approved.<br>\n" +
  //   "8. The remuneration shall be paid taking into account the Affiliate Company payment methods and payment methods at the express request of the tipster.</p>\n" +
  //   "\n" +
  //   "<p><strong>&sect; 15 Blocking of the tipster</strong><br><br>\n" +
  //   "(1) In the event that the tipster does not provide the requested evidence within 14 days of being requested to do so by Affiliate Company, e.g. in the context of account verification, the KYC procedure or the purchase of services, Affiliate Company is entitled to temporarily block the tipster and/or tipster until such time as the requested evidence is provided. The period of a block does not entitle the tipster to extraordinary termination and likewise does not give rise to a refund of services already paid for or a claim for damages, unless the tipster is not responsible for the block.<br>\n" +
  //   "(2) Commission claims that cannot be paid out due to the reasons mentioned shall be booked as a provision within Affiliate Company and shall become statute-barred at the latest within the statutory limitation periods, unless otherwise stipulated in this contract. <br>\n" +
  //   "(3) For each case of the reminder, Affiliate Company is entitled to reimburse the costs necessary for this reminder.<br>\n" +
  //   "(4) Regardless of the blocking reasons mentioned in paragraph (1), Affiliate Company reserves the right to block for an important reason. In particular, Affiliate Company reserves the right to block the access of the tipster and/or tipster without observing a deadline if the tipster violates the obligations specified in &sect;&sect; 7 - 9 and &sect; 10 paragraphs (3) and (4), or violates other applicable law, or if there is any other important reason. Unless there is an immediate reason for termination and Affiliate Company sends a warning to the tipster in accordance with &sect;11 (1), the blocking will be lifted again, provided that the tipster removes the corresponding breach of duty on the warning of Affiliate Company within the set period.</p>\n" +

Notwithstanding this, the tipster has the option of terminating his tipster at any time within the 12-month contract period with a notice period of one month to the end of the month.<br>\n" +
  //   "(2) Notwithstanding the reason for termination in (1), Affiliate Company reserves the right to terminate for good cause. An important reason exists in particular in the event of a breach of one of the obligations regulated in &sect; 7, if the tipster does not fulfil his obligation to remove within the meaning of &sect; 11 paragraph (1) in due time or if the same or a comparable breach occurs again at a later date after the breach of duty has been remedied. In the event of a breach of the obligations regulated in &sect; 8, 9 and 10 (3) and (4) as well as in the event of a particularly serious breach of the contractual or statutory law in &sect; 7 or other applicable contractual or statutory law, Affiliate Company is entitled to extraordinary termination without prior warning. There is also an extraordinary reason for termination if the tipster does not comply with the requirements of &sect; 14 (2) and (3) and allows this period to elapse fruitlessly even after a blocking in accordance with &sect; 16 (1) and a final deadline for fulfilling the requirements. Furthermore, there is an extraordinary reason for termination for each party if insolvency proceedings have been opened against the other party, or the opening was rejected for lack of assets, or the other party is otherwise insolvent, or has submitted an affidavit of insolvency as part of the enforcement. The right to extraordinary termination is without prejudice to further claims. <br>\n" +
  //   "(3) In the event of premature termination of a contract with a minimum term, there is no entitlement to reimbursement of the fees/remuneration paid, except for the tipster has terminated the contract extraordinarily for an important reason.<br>\n" +
  //   "4. A tipster can register with Affiliate Company again by another sponsor after an ordinary termination of his old position. The prerequisite is that the ordinary termination and the confirmation of the termination by Affiliate Company for the old position of the tipster are at least 6 months ago and the terminating tipster has not performed any activities for Affiliate Company during this time.<br>\n" +
  //   "(5) Upon termination of the contract, the tipster is not entitled to commission, in particular no commercial agent compensation claim, since the tipster is not a commercial agent within the meaning of the Commercial Code.<br>\n" +
  //   "(6) If a tipster at the same time claims other services of Affiliate Company that are independent of the tipster, these services remain unaffected by the termination of the tipster contract in force, unless the tipster expressly demands their termination with the termination and such termination is permissible. If the tipster continues to purchase services from Affiliate Company after the termination of the contract, he will be managed as a normal customer.<br>\n" +
