  // .................     start Questions  ...........................................

  what_defi: "什么是 DeFi？",
  what_defi_desc:
    `
    <p> DeFi 代表“去中心化金融”，是描述加密货币或区块链中各种金融应用的总称——这使得银行等金融中介机构能够去中心化。 你们都知道中央金融机构是如何运作的。 他们拥有您和其他客户存入的所有资金，每当您需要向某人汇款或从银行获得贷款时，您都会经历一个漫长、官僚和乏味的过程。 除了效率低下，银行在交易费用方面收取一定比例的资金。 </p>
    <p> DeFi 所做的是让金融交易更快、更便宜，而且通常更高效 .</p>
    <p> DeFi 让人们无需相互信任即可轻松进行金融交易。 因此，DeFi 平台建立在区块链之上，并借助智能合约促进金融交易。 </p>
    <p> DeFi 允许加密货币企业家在分散的结构中重建传统金融工具，不受银行和中央当局的控制。 </p>
  `,
  what_smart_contract: "什么是智能合约？",
  what_smart_contract_desc:
    `
  <p>智能合约是充当中介的自动化应用程序。</p>
  <p>这是区块链中的一段代码，可帮助同行（人类和应用程序，如其他智能合约）在平台上进行交互，而无需相互信任。</p>
  <p>智能合约代码始终是公开可用的，这就是为什么区块链技术通常被称为“不可信”的原因。</p>
 `,
  what_liquidity_meaning: "什么是流动性挖矿？",
  what_liquidity_meaning_desc:
    `
    <p> 流动性挖矿意味着将代币添加到 DEX（去中心化交易所）的流动性池中，例如 Uniswap、Sushiswap 或 PancakeSwap。</p>
    <p> 通过向市场提供流动性，您可以让去中心化交易所发挥作用，作为回报，您将获得加密货币的回报。</p>
    <p> 为去中心化交易所增加流动性被称为“流动性挖矿”，因为它可以像挖矿比特币或以太坊等加密货币一样为您带来利润。</p>
    <p> 流动性挖矿和加密货币挖矿都是产生基于区块链的被动收入的绝佳方式。</p>
  `,
  what_liquidity_pool: "究竟什么是“流动资金池”？",
  what_liquidity_pool_desc: `当你使用像 Binance 或 Coinbase 这样的中心化交易所时，流动性由拥有交易所的公司提供。 由于去中心化交易所没有自己的储备，流动性由将自己的资金锁定在流动性池中的用户提供。 简而言之，流动性池允许你在 DEX 上买卖加密货币。`,
  what_dao: "什么是去中心化自治组织 (DAO)？",
  what_dao_desc:
    `
      <p> 去中心化自治组织 (DAO) 是在区块链上运行的软件，它为用户提供了一个内置模型，用于对其代码进行集体管理。 </p>
      <p> DAO 不同于由董事会、委员会和高管管理的传统组织。 DAO 不是由有限的群体管理，而是使用一组写在代码中的规则，并由运行共享软件的计算机网络强制执行。 </p>
      <p> 要成为 DAO 的成员，用户需要首先通过购买其加密货币来加入 DAO。 持有资产通常会赋予用户对提案和更新进行投票的权力，这与他们持有的数量成正比。 </p>
    `,
  what_dao_governance: "什么是 DAO 治理？",
  what_dao_governance_desc:
    `
      <p>DAO 治理使用授予投票权的代币或 NFT 进行协调</p>
      <p>DAO 列表仅限于验证加密货币钱包中这些监管代币所有权的人。并且可以交换会员治理是通过成员通过区块链投票的一系列提案来实现的。拥有更多监管代币通常会带来更多投票权。</p>
    `,

  how_use_network: "如何使用 GYM NETWORK？",
  how_use_network_desc:
    `
      <p> 您可以将其用作保险库、单一农场和流动性挖矿。 因此，您可以通过三种方式从代币中获得更多收益。 </p>
      <p> 与此同时，我们一直致力于 GYMNET 代币的实用性。 您持有的 GYMNET 代币越多，您就越能更好地参与未来的项目！ 请参阅 Meta-networks.io 路线图。 您将需要 GYMNET 代币才能获得独家福利并同时获得 GYMNET 奖励。 </p>
      <p> 总而言之，这意味着：您可以将 GYM NETWORK 用作 DeFi 平台，也可以用作不断发展的元界。 当然，要建立会员职业并赚取丰厚的佣金！ </p>
    `,
  which_wallet_use_to_connect: "我可以使用哪些钱包进行连接？",
  which_wallet_use_to_connect_desc: `您可以在 WALLET CONNECT 项下使用 Metamask、Trust Wallet 和所有提供的钱包。`,
  what_apy_apr: "什么是 APY 和 APR？",
  what_apy_apr_desc:
    `
     <p>APR 代表赚取或借钱的年利率。</p>
     <p>APY 考虑复利，但 APR 没有。</p>
  `,
  where_rewords_vaults_come_from: `宝库中的奖励从何而来？`,
  where_rewords_vaults_come_from_desc:
    `
      <p>每个保险库都连接到众所周知且完善的 DeFi 协议。 在这种情况下，BNB/GYMNET 保险库连接到 Alpaca 平台。</p>
      <p>例如，用户可以有息借钱。 这个好处就是你的奖励。 作为用户，您还将从我们的平台获得 GYMNET 代币作为奖励 。</p>
      <p>与没有 GYM NETWORK 的直接使用 Alpaca 的用户相比，这将为您带来优势！ 例如 </p>
   `,
  who_what_alpaca: "谁或什么是  ALPACA？",
  who_what_alpaca_desc:
    `
    <p>
      <a href='https://www.alpacafinance.org/' target='_blank'>Alpaca Finance<a/>
      是最大的借贷协议，允许在币安智能链上进行杠杆耕作，为贷方提供安全稳定的回报。 并为高回报的农业工作提供低抵押贷款。 大幅增加农业成本和后续利润。
    </p>
  `,
  what_binance: "什么是Binance Smart Chain?",
  what_binance_desc: `Binance Chain由Binance于2019年4月推出。其主要重点是促进快速、分散（或非监管）的贸易。也许不出所料，最大的分散式应用程序（或DApp）是Binance DEX，那里最友好的分散式交易所之一。您可以在binance.org通过Web界面或通过其与Trust Wallet的本机集成来使用它。`,
  what_do_with_gymnet: "我可以用GYMNET令牌做什么?",
  what_do_with_gymnet_desc:
    `
      <p>您持有的GYMNET令牌越多,您就能更好地访问未来的项目!请参阅Meta-networks.io路线图。你将需要GYMNET令牌获得独家福利，同时GYMNET奖励。</p>
      <p>使用桉例是：您可以使用GYM NETWORK及其奖励令牌GYMNET作为VAULT、Single Farm和Liquidity Mining中的DeFi平台,以及一个不断发展的元宇宙。</p>
   `,
  where_gymnet_lysted: "GYMNET令牌在哪里上市?",
  where_gymnet_lysted_desc: `你可以在CoinMarketCap和CoinGecko上找到GYMNET。它可以在PancakeSwap上交易。`,
  where_find_tutorials: "在哪里可以找到教程?",
  where_find_tutorials_desc: `您可以访问我们YouTube频道上的所有视频教程,也可以访问Gitbook上的文档。`,
  how_affiliate_work: " 联属系统如何运作?",
  how_affiliate_work_desc:
    `
      <p>联属系统直接通过你的钱包工作。每个钱包必须链接到一个电报帐户时，你注册（只有通过邀请与会员链接）。这对于支持请求非常重要,而且更重要!</p>
      <p>之后，将为您分配自己的关联链接，您可以使用该链接成为会员。如果现在有人注册并投资金库并获得奖励，你也会得到"被动"佣金。</p>
      <p>所以，每当你被推荐的投资者（你有推荐身份）决定使用GYM NETWORK并获得他的第一个VAULT奖励时，你就会得到佣金。一遍又一遍，只要用户离开他在Vault的投资。这样你就可以积累利润丰厚的被动收入。</p>
      <p>联属系统共有16个关卡和其他亮点，将帮助你开始作为一个提示！查看网络研讨会或演示文稿PDF,或联系赞助商了解更多详细信息。</p>

         You've probably heard of <b>mining</b> before. Especially <b>bitcoin mining</b> has been very popular in recent years. Staking can be understood as a counterpart to mining.
       </p>
       <p>
         Mining often uses the <b>proof-of-work (PoW)</b> method, where computational tasks have to be solved by hardware, such as graphics cards, in order to mine a Bitcoin, for example. Staking,
         on the other hand, is based on the <b>proof-of-stake (PoS)</b> method, in which new blocks are created on the blockchain by providing coins or tokens.
       </p>
       <p>
         Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. <b>Mining</b>, for example, is <b>very power-intensive,</b> while staking hardly consumes any power.

        One thing is clear, the Metaverse is already <b>the next big thing.</b> It will play a major role in shaping our future, as long as companies like Meta,
        Disney, Microsoft and many more continue to invest so much in this new technology of the future. <b>The hype around the metaverse</b> has become a real investment opportunity that many people are already using to earn a living.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as we see the world through the smartphone today, the metaverse or the various metaverses will possibly change our view in the future. If you want tob
        <b>profit from the metaverse</b> today and even secure a good investment for the future, now is the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though through <b>Meta (Facebook)</b> seemingly the whole world is talking about Metaverse, nevertheless
        <b>less than 1% of humanity</b> is even <b>invested in Metaverse projects</b> or deals with it more closely.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Metaverse</b> therefore holds <b>immeasurable potential,</b> which people in search of new opportunities should not ignore.

        <b>DeFi, Yield Farming</b> and <b>Staking</b> are more popular than ever. But unfortunately for the normal user also quite complicated. <b>GYM Network's</b>

      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest problem for many users who want to increase their coins through

      <p>
        Without proper instruction from an expert, you can easily burn money on such <b>DEX.</b> Because many do not know which coins to combine in yield farming or do not even come to it, because the many steps overwhelm you.

        <b>GYM Network</b> was aware of this issue, that's why they created several ways to generate lucrative returns with just a few clicks. At the same time, GYM Network enables attractive
