            <h2>Staking, farming, liquidity mining</h2>
            <p>
              Before we get to the ways you can
              <b> make money directly with GYM Network, </b> it is first
              important for many people to know what staking, farming or
              liquidity mining even means.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="py-1" id="what-staking">
            <h2>What is Staking?</h2>
            <p>
              You've probably heard of <b>mining</b> before. Especially
              <b>bitcoin mining</b> has been very popular in recent years.
              Staking can be understood as a counterpart to mining.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mining often uses the <b>proof-of-work (PoW)</b> method, where
              computational tasks have to be solved by hardware, such as
              graphics cards, in order to mine a Bitcoin, for example. Staking,
              on the other hand, is based on the
              <b>proof-of-stake (PoS)</b> method, in which new blocks are
              created on the blockchain by providing coins or tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. <b>Mining</b>, for
              example, is <b>very power-intensive,</b>
              while staking hardly consumes any power.

          <div class="py-1" id="yield">
            <h2>What is Yield Farming?</h2>
            <p>
              Yield farming is a combination of the terms “yield” and “farming”.
              You can imagine Yield Farming as the cultivation of vegetables.
              You sow something and it grows. However, with
              <b>Yield Farming</b> you don't have to water or take care of the
              plants, because the yields are produced automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the time,
              <b>Yield Farming combines two coins together into a pair of to</b>
              kens to produce yields.

            <h2>What is Liquidity Mining?</h2>

            <h2>How to earn crypto with GYM</h2>
            <p>
              Now that you know what ways there are to earn earnings and rewards
              in the form of cryptocurrencies, let's show you what makes
              <b>GYM Network's services</b> so special. GYM Network currently
              offers <b>3 ways to earn GYMNET.</b>

          <div class="py-1" id="vault">
            <h2>GYM Vault</h2>
            <p>
              <b>GYM Network's Vault</b> is the easiest and safest way. You can
              start with a minimum amount of 0.051 BNB. These BNB will then
              produce GYMNET.
            </p>
            <p>
              In doing so, you <b>don't have to lock</b> your deployed
              cryptocurrency, nor are there extra fees to withdraw it. You can
              always <b>take out your cryptocurrency again</b> in a few seconds
              and transfer it to your wallet.
            </p>

            <p>
              Especially for critical people who may have lost money in the
              crypto world, the Vault offers a unique
              <b>combination of security and liquidity.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>GYM Network</b> has ensured even more security by having the
              cryptocurrency used reside with
              <a href="https://www.alpacafinance.org/" target="blank">ALPACA</a
              >, one of the most secure <b>DeFi Yield farming platforms</b> that
              has been tested through many audits. What this means for you is
              that even if GYM's user interface should ever malfunction, you can
              still access your deployed cryptos.
            </p>
            <p>
              This makes <b>GYM Network's Vault</b> one of the most profitable,
              secure and flexible ways to earn cryptos in the DeFi space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Convince yourself of the <b>simplicity of the Vault</b> and start
              producing your DeFi earnings.

            <h2>GYM Farming</h2>
            <p>
              In <b>GYM Network Farming,</b> you combine the GYMNET with another
              coin to generate <b>GYMNET earnings.</b> As described above, you
              provide liquidity, for which you receive
              <b>GYMNET as a reward.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              The flexibility is also maintained in farming, which means that
              you can take out your invested coins at any time. The big
              <b>advantage of farming</b> on GYM Network is that, unlike farming
              on many other DEXs, it is extremely simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              You don't need to learn GYM's platform, nor do you need to have
              any knowledge. It only takes a <b>few clicks,</b> and you have
              your coins combined and farmed.
            </p>
            <p>
              You don't have to go through the hassle of buying coins, combining
              them, tying them into a token pair, and so on.

              The <b>Single Pool</b> also serves another important function.
              Affiliate partners can qualify for certain ranks by placing GYMNET
              in the Single Pool. They do not need to be blocked for this
