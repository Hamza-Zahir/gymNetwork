            <h2>Metaverse, the hype is on!</h2>
            <p>
              The hype around the <b>Metaverse</b> really took off when Facebook
              changed its name to Meta. Even though some companies had already
              built up their own metaverses, such as
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentraland"
                target="_blank"
                >“Decentraland”</a
              >
              or
              <a
                href="https://medium.com/sandbox-game/what-is-the-sandbox-850de68d893e"
                target="_blank"
                >“The Sandbox”</a
              >, many people first heard about Metaverse when Facebook announced
              that it would establish its own metaverse.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is therefore not surprising that many believe there is only one
              <b>Metaverse of Meta (Facebook).</b> In fact, many companies have
              already entered the new market and are building their own
              Metaverse. But what actually is a metaverse?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="py-1" id="what-metaverse">
            <h2>What is the Metaverse?</h2>
            <p>
              The <b>Metaverse</b> is a virtual world where everything is
              possible. Entertainment, sports, education, finance and much more
              meet there. It is supposed to represent the future of our daily
              lives. A future that we will spend more than ever online.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you take the <b>term Metaverse</b> apart once, you get the two
              terms “Meta” and “Universe”. “Meta” means something like “between”
              or “in the midst of”. “Universe” means, off course “universe”.
            </p>
            <p>
              So the <b>Metaverse</b> is an in-between place or in-between
              universe that we enter when we log in or put on a VR headset. It
              is a <b>digital parallel world</b> that will reveal incredible
              possibilities to us.
            </p>

          <div class="py-1" id="there-metaverse">
            <h2>There is not the one metaverse</h2>
            <p>
              Whenever we talk about Metaverse, we should keep in mind that
              there is not one Metaverse. Even though Meta (Facebook) is
              currently investing a lot of money in its Metaverse, there are
              plenty of other
              <b>big players</b> who are currently
              <b>developing their own Metaverse.</b>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="py-1" id="best">
            <h2>The best known Metaverse projects</h2>
            <p>
              Among the most well-known Metaverse projects are
              <b>The Sandbox</b> and <b>Decentraland.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Decentraland has been around since 2015, but it only became more
              popular around 2017. Today, it is one of the
              <b>biggest metaverses.</b> Decentraland is a virtual reality
              platform based on blockchain technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              People can explore the world with avatars, like in a video game,
              and also purchase <b>digital land</b> in the form of
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token"
                target="_blank"
                >NFTs</a
              >. People can then create virtual spaces on their own land. This
              can be anything, such as a gallery where you exhibit your pictures
              or a social media platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sandbox takes a similar approach to Decentraland. It is a
              video game with a trading place and a meanwhile very large
              community. With its own cryptocurrency “SAND” it is, as of July
              2022,

                ranked #35 on coinmarketcap</a
              >
              with over $1.5 billion.
            </p>

          <div class="py-1" id="world">
            <h2>The world of finance in metaverse</h2>
            <p>
              Metaverse has not been a vision or a concept for a long time.
              <b>Millions of people invest</b> in new and also established
              <b>Metaverse projects</b> every day because they recognize the
              potential behind them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sandbox and Decentraland are the best examples of
              <b>investments in the millions</b>, which are not only spent by
              well-known rappers like Snoop Dog on virtual land. In fact,
              <b>numerous companies own land</b> in Sandbox or Decentraland,
              such as Ubisoft, TikTok, Samsung, Adidas, Atari and many more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Virtual land has thus become a real investment, which has already
              been recognized by the world's largest companies, who have
              expanded their <b>portfolios with NFTs</b> from Metaversen.
            </p>
            <p>
              So it's no wonder that many companies have taken notice of this
              future technology and want to develop their very own Metaverse.

          <div class="py-1" id="potential">
            <h2>The potential of Metaverse</h2>
            <p>
              Just as the <b>Internet</b> and the <b>smartphone</b> have
              <b>fundamentallychanged our daily lives,</b> the Metaverse has the
              potential to do the same. In the past, people would never have
              imagined that they could organize their relationships, finances,
              health, in short, their entire lives from a small, handy device.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, people spend a large part of their time in front of
              their smartphones, far more than in front of their PCs or laptops.
              The world already takes place mainly
              <b>in the virtual realm.</b> The metaverse is just the
              <b>next evolutionary step.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              No one can say today which metaverse will ultimately prevail. But
              what we do know is that the
              <b>potential of the metaverse is huge.</b>

            </p>
            <p>
              But it's not that easy, because there are also many dubious

              One thing is clear, the Metaverse is already
              <b>the next big thing.</b> It will play a major role in shaping
              our future, as long as companies like Meta, Disney, Microsoft and
              many more continue to invest so much in this new technology of the
              future. <b>The hype around the metaverse</b> has become a real
              investment opportunity that many people are already using to earn
              a living.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as we see the world through the smartphone today, the
              metaverse or the various metaverses will possibly change our view
              in the future. If you want tob
              <b>profit from the metaverse</b> today and even secure a good
              investment for the future, now is the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though through <b>Meta (Facebook)</b> seemingly the whole
              world is talking about Metaverse, nevertheless
              <b>less than 1% of humanity</b> is even
              <b>invested in Metaverse projects</b> or deals with it more
              closely.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>Metaverse</b> therefore holds
              <b>immeasurable potential,</b> which people in search of new
