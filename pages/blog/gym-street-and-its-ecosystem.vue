          <h2>What is GYM Street?</h2>
          <p>
            Before we look at the individual partners, we first need to answer
            the question of <b> what exactly GYM Street is.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the last blog post, you already learned
            <b>what the Metaverse</b> is and the potential behind it for each of
            us. If you don't know what Metaverse means yet, then be sure to read
            the post: <b>“Metaverse and its Potential”.</b> You'll be amazed at
            how it can change our world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>GYM Street</b> is a Metaverse that, like already established
            Metaverse, such as Sandbox or Decentraland, will not only create a
            virtual space with many possibilities, but will provide even more
            solutions for digital finance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>GYM Street's mission</b>
            is to create a metaverse with the
            <b>best crypto financial services</b> to provide easy access to
            <b>lucrative DeFi products</b> for everyone in the world.
          </p>
          <p><b>GYM Street's goals are:</b></p>

          <ul class="style">
            <li>Creating digital jobs</li>
            <li>To build a diverse blockchain & crypto ecosystem</li>
            <li>
              A platform to educate about crypto world, DeFi and Metaverse.
            </li>
            <li>Creating exceptional Metaverse experiences</li>

          <h2>The growth potential of metaverse</h2>
          <p>
            You already know how strongly the industry of
            <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-nft-virtual-land-in-the-metaverse" target="blank">
              NFTs is growing as virtual land</a>
            in different metaverses from the last blog post
            <b>
              “Metaverse and its potential”. Companies are spending millions</b>
            to buy virtual land and position their brand there.
          </p>
          <p>
            These companies see tremendous
            <b> growth potential in the metaverse,</b> and it has more to do
            with the fact that the land they acquire is associated with a likely
            increase in value. Rather, they see the added
            <b> value in the advertising</b> and positioning they have with a
            <b>popular location in a metaverse</b> with millions of users.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's similar to having a popular store right in the pedestrian mall
            of a major city. The more people who see the store, the
            <b>stronger the brand positions</b> itself in the brains of these
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this marketing, companies want to position themselves not only
            in the already established metaverses. <b>Emerging metaverses</b> in
            particular are becoming increasingly popular for companies, as well
            as individuals, who want to participate in the growth market.

          <h2>Earn money with virtual land from GYM Street</h2>

          <p>
            Virtual land is becoming increasingly popular, especially for people
            for whom <b>real property is too expensive</b> but still want to
            participate in the market.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>GYM Street</b> combines the purchase of virtual land with other
            unique DeFi products. For example, miners can be placed on each
            purchased land parcel, <b>producing daily yields.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, one can not only benefit from the probable increase in value
            of virtual land, but also earn coins directly with his land.
