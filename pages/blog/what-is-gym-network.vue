            A DeFi aggregator is a system that aggregates trading across

            in one place. The result is the greatest possible yield, combined
            with the saving of time-consuming searches for new staking or
            farming opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>

            or other methods are the sometimes very complicated and many steps
            that have to be taken on decentralized exchanges (DEX), such as
            <a

          </p>
          <p>
            Without proper instruction from an expert, you can easily burn money
            on such DEX because you don't know which coins to combine in yield
            farming or you don't even get to it because the many steps overwhelm
            you.

            The mission of GYM Network is to help shape a world in which
            everyone can be a part of the digital future and, as an investor,
            shape their financial freedom themselves.
          </p>

            In doing so, GYM Network creates nothing less than the solutions of

          <h2>GYM Vault</h2>

          <p>
            With the vault from GYM you can generate income with your coins at
            the same time and transfer them back to your wallet at any time
            without having to pay extra fees. The Vault is the most flexible GYM
            Network product and is particularly suitable for people who value
            security and liquidity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The BNB or other coins used are held by
            <a href="https://www.alpacafinance.org/" target="blank">ALPACA</a> ,
            one of the most respected and secure DeFi yield farming platforms.
            There they produce GYMNET in real time, which you can have paid out
            to your wallet at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            GYMNET, the coin from GYM Network, is already listed on numerous
            platforms and exchanges and can be sold again, for example via
            pancakeswap. So with the GYMNET you don't get just any coin that you
            can't do anything with, but you can switch it directly to other
            coins or use it for the following products.
          </p>

            Want to try the Vault right away? In the GYM Vault you can start
            with small amounts.

          <h2>GYM Farming</h2>
          <p>
            Farming GYM Network is another lucrative way to generate GYMNET. In
            farming, you combine GYMNET with, for example, BNB and provide them
            to the platform as liquidity. For this you get daily rewards in
            GYMNET.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can remove your coins at any time, just like in the vault, so
            you are completely flexible.

        <div class="py-1" id="SinglePool">

          <p>
            The GYM Network single pool offers the opportunity to further
            increase your GYMNET. By locking them for a period of time and
            making them available for staking, you get profitable rewards.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, the single pool is necessary for the commissions in the
            affiliate system.

            If you are enthusiastic about GYM Network and its services, you can
            even build up your own passive income with the extensive affiliate
            system. GYM Network offers one of the first affiliate systems based
            on Blockchain and Smart Contracts. This always ensures that your
            commissions, which you receive by recommending GYM Network and its
            services, are automatically distributed to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can easily become an affiliate partner by starting with the
            Vault. You will then automatically receive an affiliate link that
            you can pass on to others.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they then start with the Vault or another GYM Network product,
            you will receive a reward for the yields produced by your customers
            every time. You earn recurring income while your affiliates and
            clients do too. A win-win situation.

            Transparency is an important value at GYM Network, lived through
            regular AMAs (Ask me anything) with the GYM Network team. The

            also provide GYM Network customers with a high level of
            transparency.
          </p>

          <p>
            While many other platforms are too complicated and lock coins for
            several months, GYM Network takes a particularly unique path with
            maximum flexibility. In their first product, the Vault, for example,
            income can be generated without locking up coins. In this way, the
            user always has the coins he uses liquid.
          </p>
          <p>
            The combination of flexibility, security, transparency and high
            yields make GYM Network one of the most exciting projects when it
            comes to yield farming, staking or building a crypto fortune. But
            beyond that, the GYM Network team is not satisfied with the achieved
            goals. They have big plans in their roadmap.
